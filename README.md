# Student_Activity_Log
Full Stack Project which uses LAMP Stack

The goal of the Student Activity Log project is to provide a thorough system for monitoring involvement in activities and attendance by students. The system will be used by students to sign in and out of different activities like Placements and Special labs, recording their participation information. Reviewing these logs, approving or rejecting check-ins and check-outs, and providing comments for any denials will be within the power of faculty members. Accurate tracking of student engagement will be made possible via the technology, enabling improved support and monitoring. The entire data collection will be managed by an administrative role that has authority to view, manage student activity logs.
